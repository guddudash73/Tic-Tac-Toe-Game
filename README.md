# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

A classic Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Overview

This project is a front-end implementation of the popular Tic-Tac-Toe game. It allows two players to take turns marking X and O on a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.

## Features

- Responsive design: Works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Simple user interface: Clear instructions and easy-to-use interface.
- No backend or database required: The game runs entirely in the browser.

## How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2. Click on an empty cell to place your mark (X or O).
3. The game will automatically switch turns between players.
4. The game ends when one player wins or when all cells are filled (resulting in a draw).

## Technologies Used

- HTML: Structure of the game board.
- CSS: Styling and layout.
- JavaScript: Game logic and interactivity.
